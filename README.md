# Financial Banking Loan Data Intelligence 

# Problem Overview

### A financial institution required data-driven insights to evaluate loan performance, analyze borrower behavior, and identify regional lending trends.

### My Objective
My responsibility was to analyze the loan dataset and develop a dashboard that showcases key metrics such as:

Total loan applications

Funded amount vs amount received

Average interest rates

Debt-to-income ratios

And breakdowns of good vs bad loans, loan purposes, and regional performance

## My Approach
Data Cleaning: Performed data preprocessing and cleansing in Excel to ensure accuracy and consistency.

KPI Extraction & Validation: Extracted and validated key performance indicators using SQL queries.

Visualization & Dashboard Design: Developed interactive dashboards in Power BI for clear data presentation.

Insight Generation & Reporting: Analyzed data to derive actionable insights and prepared reports for stakeholders.

# Key finance domain terms that are essential to understand.
## 1) DTI 
--> The Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio should ideally be between 30% and 35%, as it is a key factor in determining a customerâ€™s eligibility for a loan. 

## The Dashboard is divided into 3 parts 
### 1) Summary

### Slicers
1)  Purpose 
2)  Grade 
3)  State

### 2) Overview

### Slicers
1) Select Measure -->
                 Total Amount received | Total Funded Amount | Total Loan Application |
   
3) Good loan vs Bad Loan
4) Grade
5) State

#### so the whole dashboard will change for the slicer

### 3)Details

### Slicers
1) Good vs Bad Loan
2) Grade
3) State


## Tools and use case
I leveraged a combination of Excel, Oracle SQL Developer, and Power BI to analyze the loan dataset:

In Excel, I cleaned raw CSV data, handled missing values, and performed initial exploratory analysis.

Using SQL, I extracted and validated KPIs such as monthly loan applications, funded amounts, and average DTI, ensuring data accuracy for the dashboard.

With Power BI, I created an interactive 3-page dashboard:

Summary: High-level KPIs at a glance

Overview: Monthly and regional trends

Details: In-depth insights on loan purposes, employment length, and home ownership

This workflow enabled end-to-end analysis, from raw data to actionable insights.



## Conclusion
The dashboard offered valuable insights:

Highlighted that the majority of loans were issued in states such as California and Texas. Revealed that performing loans significantly outnumbered non-performing loans.
Showed that customers with longer employment histories tended to have lower default rates. These findings enable the bank to enhance risk assessment and focus on the most suitable customer segments.
